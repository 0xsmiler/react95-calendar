                In 2018 I took part in a workshop in Lithuania at the Vilnius
                Art Academy in producing a Vaporwave Album with participants
                coming in from around Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of the weekend we produced music videos, songs
                and more. I produced two songs for the album and a music video.
                The album can be found on streaming services.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) needed a
                  website that would go online in the case of a service outage,
                  maintenance break or any other unexpected event. The website
                  would need to have three pages in Finnish, English and
                  Swedish: front page, a list of unaffected services and contact
                  information page, editable in Dreamweaver. The goal is to
                  portray a message, that the service outage is temporary and
                  will be fixed as soon as possible.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  Using custom Bootstrap styling from the other project I had
                  developed for PRH, I designed the page entity that responded
                  to the aforementioned challenges. The page entity was a
                  Bootstrap 4-powered website that would be customizable by the
                  PRH communications department. I designed the elements and
                  outlined the page which then complemented the style guide as
                  an example page as well.

                  Edunsaaja-apuri can be used to determine if an entity is
                  entitled to benefits or required for providing extra
                  information. After an accessibility audit, some fixes needed
                  to be done to make the website accessible and WCAG 2.1
                  compliant.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  Using WCAG guidelines and the audit, I fixed the accessibility
                  errors and problems with the website which was done with
                  JavaScript and HTML5&CSS. Most of the work was only code.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  The Auditor Oversight business unit of PRH had tendered out
                  the redevelopment of their digital services to Gofore, a
                  Finnish digital consultancy. However, the bid didnâ€™t include
                  any designers but only process and software developers. As the
                  only designer present in the redevelopment processes, I took
                  it upon myself to ensure that the solutions were usable,
                  accessible and responded to business demands.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  The Auditor search service was done in React with Bootstrap
                  and custom styling I had started to redevelop on another
                  project. It reflected on a developing style guide and provided
                  ideas for improvement for the design system as well.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) didnâ€™t have
                  an official document model that was used on
                  digitally-generated documents. The documents followed a simple
                  automatically generated format, meaning that they were
                  unaccessible, unrecognizable and subject to fraud. The
                  documents would have to reflect PRH and their documentsâ€™
                  official nature throughout their services from receipts to
                  registrations and patents.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  Together with another designer we designed a variety of
                  document templates that we tested in workshops internally in
                  each business unit that would be using the model. After, we
                  modified the documents to respond to workshop feedback, made
                  the documents accessible to screen readers and clarified the
                  font usage and header levels, which were then delivered to the
                  technical team as templates and instructions.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) partnered
                  with us to maintain, redevelop and redesign their custom
                  Bootstrap-styling. PRH didnâ€™t own a systematic way of
                  presenting the styles nor instructing contractors and in-house
                  developers how to use the styles, especially with
                  accessibility in mind. The custom Bootstrap-styles had
                  previously been developed by several contractors, based on
                  Bootstrap 3 and used widely on a variety of digital services.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>I suggested building a component library for
                  developers and other stakeholders to use in their daily work
                  on an open-source platform (Storybook). As part of the
                  development, I redesiged the styling, fixed accessibility
                  issues, created code snippets and documented each component
                  individually and maintained the whole component library into
                  an npm package. I developed the styleguide on JavaScript and
                  matched it with a Sketch-library from scratch to support
                  designers; a starting point of a design system for PRH.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  Solidabis is a growing software development company that has
                  had a variety of structural and cultural changes in its
                  history since the founding in 2016. The changes have led to
                  the company not having clear and concise image to potential
                  clients, future employees or the media. Logos and colors are
                  not properly defined and mixed versions of the logos are
                  circulating around in workspaces.
                  <h4>Solution</h4>I developed brand and visual styleguide to
                  help everyone in their daily client work. It includes the
                  correct color codes, tone of voice, samples of text and
                  imagery as well as proper logo usage. I designed document

                  Due to strict confidentiality and the intellectual property
                  laws implemented in the contract signed with IBM, I am not
                  allowed to present my work to outside parties nor discuss the
                  clients I have worked with. A few of the Finnish clients which
                  have publicly promoted IBMâ€™s cooperation, such as Finnair and
                  Nokia, are just some of the clients for which I worked for as
                  a designer.
                  <h4>Focus</h4>All of the work I did at IBM was
                  enterprise-centered, focusing on enterprise-level users and
                  employee experience rather than customer and commercial. Most
                  design work had to do with Watson AI-powered chatbots for
                  IBMâ€™s clients. My tasks varied from leading workshops, to user
                  interviews and tests, to collaboratively working with data
                  scientists, developers and product owners on a daily basis.

                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  Helsinki City Transport HKL organized an open call for
                  artworks for all the metro stations in the Helsinki branch.
                  Participation was anonymous and the submissions would be
                  judged based on the artistic value and historical implications
                  as well as timelessness. Together with a good friend of mine,{" "}
                  <a href="http://misaelrojas.com/">Misael Rojas</a>, we
                  submitted an artwork for the University of Helsinki metro
                  station, which is one of the three busiest metro stations in
                  Helsinki due to its location near the governmental, private
                  enterprise hubs.
                  <h4>Outcome</h4>The design takes into account the historical
                  nature of the station, being the last one to be completed in
                  Helsinki in the late 90s. Neon lights and tile patterns
                  complement the stationâ€™s spirit. We took nearly 300 images
                  from which we vectorized shapes from iconic buildings around
                  the station. It gives the daily user of the metro station
                  something new to look for and spot in their surroundings
                  during their daily routines.

                <p>
                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  In 2018 I worked as a Communications Intern at the City of
                  Helsinki Urban Environment Division. During the summer I
                  noticed the largest construction site of Central Library Oodi
                  being surrounded by light green wooden walls. In front of the
                  Finnish Parliament, it is the most central site in Helsinki. I
                  gathered funding and organized to get artists from womensâ€™
                  collective Mimmit Peinttaa to cover these walls with art and
                  stories.
                  <h4>Outcome</h4>The walls were painted in early September. I
                  made and designed the promotional texts and logos in stencil
                  form for the city and companies. The works have appeared in
                  many publications such as Helsingin Sanomat and several
                  Instagram accounts.
