This little project is made with [React95](https://github.com/React95/React95) bootstrapped with Vite and a little experimentation. I am not a developer so for sure this code could be much more efficient and pretty than it is.

## Vite & React95

Check out the great [starter kit for Vite and React95](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react95-vite-starter) made by the great [ggdaltoso](https://github.com/ggdaltoso) if you want yourself a clean slate.
